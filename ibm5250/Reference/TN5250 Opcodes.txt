Subject: Re: 5250 Data Stream Operation Codes

I wish to point out the opcode list in that document is sadly incomplete and
out of date. You will want to consider handling a more complete set, like
this:

    x00  No operation
    x01  Invite op
    x02  Put
    x03  Put-then-Get
    x04  Save screen
    x05  Restore screen
    x06  Read immediate
    x07  Read mod immediate alt
    x08  Read screen
    x09  Internally generated Put (not used in DSPT)
    x0A  Cancel invite
    x0B  Turn on MSG light
    x0C  Turn off MSG light
    x0D  Read screen with extd attributes
    x0E  Read screen to print
    x0F  Read screen to print extd attributes
    x10  Read screen to print with gridline
    x11  Read screen to print with gridline with extd attributes

Sorry but I don't know of any documentation on op codes. As far as I know,
none exists. I hope someone can prove me wrong.

Good luck, Barry Hansen
